              Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! This site is under permanent construction as I will always be improving it.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              This site was designed with Next.js, React, JavaScript, Hero
              Icons, and React Color, with more to come. I can build full stack
              applications utilizing Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RESTful API
              development, React, Tailwind, Threejs, HTML, ES6, and CSS. I Have built and rebuilt small applications you can find
              on this site from scratch to demonstrate some of my proficiency as well as links to the code on my github.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              I currently have over 1,000 of hours of coding experience and I love
              programming! I am open to remote, relocation, and in-person work. I'm eager to learn, moldable, and I am often told by
              colleagues that I am very relaxed. I hope to be a great fit in my
              upcoming work environment.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              I have a wonderful family of five who supports me in my coding
              endeavors. I'm grateful for all that I have!
