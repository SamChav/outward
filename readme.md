<h2>About this application</h2>

<p>Hi, this is the repository for my portfolio. The live website can be found <a href="https://portfolio-w55q.onrender.com/">here</a>. I will consistenly update this portfolio to showcase all of the projects and work I do and may even change the layout from time to time.</p>

<h2>Purpose of this portfolio</h2>

<p>The purpose of this is to showcase my proficencies with JavaScript and development in general. In the main menu of my portfolio you can find links to small works that exist on the application itself as well as links to external sites. All of the code showcased is my work as an individual and does not currently reflect any team work project, but I do enjoy working on teams. I am currently open to work and if you like what you see here, please reach out to me at chavez.samuel1@gmail.com. Thank you!</p>
